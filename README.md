DreamCatcher is an AI Chatbot that will take user inputted dreams to visually reconstruct and interpret them. DreamCatcher will take an input of text provided by the user describing as much of the dream as possible, and use this text data, along with follow up questions if applicable, to perform itâ€™s analysis. 

This chatbot ideally will be a part of a larger AI virtual morning assistant that makes suggestions for the day to the user based on their profile and mood drawn from their inputted dreams.
